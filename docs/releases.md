# SDK Explorer releases

This is the manual release procedure. There is no `bun run release` command.
`build`, `package` write local files only. CI validates
source, workflow policy and clean packages; it does not create tags, upload assets or
publish releases. A green CI run is not a published package.

## Prerequisites and release PR

Use macOS Apple silicon (`uname -s` is `Darwin`, `uname -m` is `arm64`), Bun 1.4.2
(the CI version), Git, `gh` and `gh-axi`. Check `bun --version`, `git config user.name`,
`git config user.email` and `gh auth status`. Authentication must allow pushing tags and
writing repository releases (Contents write for a fine-grained token). Authentication
alone does not prove that permission: confirm repository access with the maintainer.
Have an authorized stable/prerelease decision, a compatible Toolbelt Plugin Tester and
space for retained build/download/verification directories. Do not replace installed
apps or use real user data for acceptance.

The pinned `@toolbelt/sdk` URL in `package.json` and `bun.lock` must already be publicly
accessible. An unpublished SDK or a sibling source checkout cannot satisfy a release.
For an SDK update, first publish/verify that SDK through Toolbelt's SDK procedure, then
update this dependency and lockfile in a PR and rerun all checks. Do not silently resolve
a different URL during the release build.

Create a release branch and PR from current `main`. In that PR:

1. Set the same new plugin version in root `package.json` and `toolbelt.json`. Use a
   never-published version, with a prerelease suffix when appropriate.
2. Move the intended `CHANGELOG.md` Unreleased entries into `## X.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD`.
   Keep an empty Unreleased section for later work. Review the release notes.
3. Update `bun.lock` if package metadata or dependencies require it; frozen installation
   must succeed.
4. The current `scripts/verify-package.ts` uses the literal archive version `0.0.1`.
   The release PR must align these verifier references with the new version, or
   explicitly parameterize them and update CI before release. They currently accept no
   archive-path argument. Never rename a new archive to an old version to bypass this gate.
5. Run the validation commands below and obtain green required CI. Have the user merge
   the release PR; agents must not merge `main` or publish stable releases without the
   user's explicit authorization.

## Select and validate the exact source

Run from this repository, after the release PR is merged. These blocks are sequential;
use zsh (the macOS default) or bash and retain the variables in the same shell. Stop on any failed check. Do not run alongside
another session editing this checkout.

```sh
set -e
release_repo=tkarakai/toolbelt-sdk-demo
git fetch origin --tags
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
test -z "$(git status --porcelain)"
release_commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
test "$release_commit" = "$(git rev-parse origin/main)"
release_version=$(bun -e 'console.log((await Bun.file("package.json").json()).version)')
release_tag="v$release_version"
release_archive="toolbelt-sdk-demo-${release_version}-darwin-arm64.tar.gz"
bun -e 'const p=await Bun.file("package.json").json(); const m=await Bun.file("toolbelt.json").json(); if(p.version!==m.version) throw Error("Version mismatch")'
```

Confirm the required `CI` status is green for this exact merged commit in GitHub
(the release PR's earlier head alone is insufficient). Confirm the intended tag and release do not already
exist with `git ls-remote --tags origin` and `gh-axi release list`. If either exists,
follow recovery below instead of rebuilding/recreating it.

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run package
bun scripts/verify-package.ts
test -z "$(git status --porcelain)"
```

`package` invokes `build`; a separate `bun run build` is unnecessary. It produces
`dist/package` and these release assets under `artifacts/`:

- `toolbelt-sdk-demo-<version>-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`: complete ustar plugin archive.
- The archive's `.sha256` sidecar.
- `toolbelt-release.json`: `formatVersion: 1`, id `sdk-demo`, version,
  repo `tkarakai/toolbelt-sdk-demo`, full source `commit`, and one package with target
  `darwin-arm64`, exact asset filename, byte `size` and `sha256`.

The plugin archive must run without this source tree or ambient `node_modules`.
The verifier extracts it into a fresh temporary directory, supplies isolated HOME/data
and exercises handshake, readiness, every screen, quick view, preparation and shutdown.
SDK Explorer also verifies preparation deferral and retry. Unit tests cover migration
idempotence and optional-capability fallback.

## Freeze and verify local assets

Keep this directory until after publication and recovery checks. Its bytes, not a later
rebuild, are the release candidate. `SHA256SUMS` covers every uploaded product asset,
including the descriptor and individual archive sidecar; it does not checksum itself.

```sh
release_dir=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/toolbelt-sdk-demo-release.XXXXXX")
release_files=("$release_archive" "$release_archive.sha256" toolbelt-release.json)
for release_file in "${release_files[@]}"; do
  cp "artifacts/$release_file" "$release_dir/$release_file"
done
(cd "$release_dir" && shasum -a 256 "${release_files[@]}" > SHA256SUMS)
(cd "$release_dir" && shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS)
```

Save this verifier beside the frozen bytes (it is an operator helper, not an uploaded
asset). It checks the descriptor's source binding, target, exact size/hash and sidecar.

```sh
cat > "$release_dir/verify-assets.ts" <<'VERIFY'
import {createHash} from 'node:crypto';
import {readFileSync} from 'node:fs';
import {join} from 'node:path';
const [dir,version,commit,repo,id]=process.argv.slice(2);
const d=JSON.parse(readFileSync(join(dir,'toolbelt-release.json'),'utf8'));
if(d.formatVersion!==1||d.id!==id||d.version!==version||d.repo!==repo||d.commit!==commit||d.packages?.length!==1) throw Error('Descriptor identity/source mismatch');
const p=d.packages[0], expected=`${repo.split('/')[1]}-${version}-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`;
if(p.target!=='darwin-arm64'||p.asset!==expected) throw Error('Target/filename mismatch');
const bytes=readFileSync(join(dir,p.asset));
const hash=createHash('sha256').update(bytes).digest('hex');
if(p.size!==bytes.length||p.sha256!==hash) throw Error('Size/hash mismatch');
if(readFileSync(join(dir,p.asset+'.sha256'),'utf8')!==`${hash}  ${p.asset}\n`) throw Error('Sidecar mismatch');
console.log('Descriptor, source, target, size and SHA-256 verified');
VERIFY
bun "$release_dir/verify-assets.ts" "$release_dir" "$release_version" "$release_commit" "$release_repo" sdk-demo
release_extract=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/toolbelt-sdk-demo-extract.XXXXXX")
tar -xzf "$release_dir/$release_archive" -C "$release_extract"
bun -e 'const [dir,version,repo,id]=process.argv.slice(1); const m=await Bun.file(dir+"/toolbelt.json").json(); if(m.id!==id||m.version!==version||m.repo!==repo||m.formatVersion!==1||m.protocol!==1||m.entry!=="index.js"||!m.requires.platforms.includes("darwin-arm64")) throw Error("Archive manifest mismatch"); if(!await Bun.file(dir+"/index.js").exists()) throw Error("Missing entry")' "$release_extract" "$release_version" "$release_repo" sdk-demo
```

Review the extracted manifest's compatibility ranges, capability requirements, screens,
asset declarations, schema and migration entry against the approved source.
The clean-package verifier validates the full manifest through the public SDK parser.
Inspect the extracted files: all declared assets/payloads and `migrate.js`
must exist, with executable permissions where required. NOTICE and license attribution
must remain present. Archive consumers must not need dependencies installed at runtime.

Load the frozen archive in a compatible Toolbelt Plugin Tester using a fresh isolated
profile and temporary HOME. Exercise all screens and native quick view, keyboard/search/
selection/dialogs, themes, zoom, narrow layout and packaged assets. Confirm readiness,
prepare/shutdown and update/removal data retention. Test migration/update with copied
fixture data, including retries and compatibility rejection leaving the old installation
intact. For SDK Explorer, confirm actual table sort order, payload paths, counter persistence, migration retry, Defer retry and both negotiated optional-capability fallback branches.
Do not proceed with a readiness, archive, asset or renderer failure.

Copy the approved changelog section into `$release_dir/notes.md`, review it, and include
compatibility/download instructions.
Keep the candidate's source SHA, Bun version, acceptance result and local directory
location with the release operator's records. Notes must describe these exact bytes.

## Tag, create a draft and upload

Only after validation and authorization, create an annotated tag on the exact commit.
Never force-push or move a release tag. These commands intentionally require an existing
remote tag and leave the release unpublished and excluded from Latest:

```sh
test "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$release_commit"
test -z "$(git status --porcelain)"
git tag -a "$release_tag" "$release_commit" -m "Release $release_version"
git push origin "refs/tags/$release_tag"
gh-axi release create "$release_tag" --verify-tag --draft --latest=false \
  --title "$release_tag" --notes-file "$release_dir/notes.md"
release_uploads=()
for release_file in "${release_files[@]}"; do
  release_uploads+=("$release_dir/$release_file")
done
gh-axi release upload "$release_tag" "${release_uploads[@]}" "$release_dir/SHA256SUMS"
```

Draft creation is separate from uploads so a partial upload cannot publish an incomplete
release. Do not add `--generate-notes` in place of reviewed changelog notes.

## Download the draft and verify again

```sh
release_download=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/toolbelt-sdk-demo-download.XXXXXX")
gh-axi release download "$release_tag" --dir "$release_download"
for release_file in "${release_files[@]}" SHA256SUMS; do
  cmp "$release_dir/$release_file" "$release_download/$release_file"
done
(cd "$release_download" && shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS)
bun "$release_dir/verify-assets.ts" "$release_download" "$release_version" "$release_commit" "$release_repo" sdk-demo
test "$(git rev-parse "$release_tag^{commit}")" = "$release_commit"
gh release view "$release_tag" --repo "$release_repo" \
  --json tagName,isDraft,isPrerelease,targetCommitish,assets
```

Raw `gh` is used for structured metadata inspection. Require `isDraft: true`, the exact
tag, expected asset count/names/sizes, reviewed notes and the correct tagged commit.
`targetCommitish` can be a branch name; the annotated tag's peeled commit and descriptor
must match the approved full SHA. Confirm remote tag refs using `git ls-remote --tags
origin` (including its peeled `^{}` entry). No extra/stale product assets may remain.

Verify the downloaded archive through the real verifier, not only the local build.
Create a disposable checkout at the tagged source; do not build/package in this checkout:

```sh
release_verify=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/toolbelt-sdk-demo-verify.XXXXXX")
git clone --no-checkout "https://github.com/$release_repo.git" "$release_verify/source"
git -C "$release_verify/source" checkout --detach "$release_commit"
mkdir -p "$release_verify/source/artifacts"
for release_file in "${release_files[@]}"; do
  cp "$release_download/$release_file" "$release_verify/source/artifacts/$release_file"
done
(cd "$release_verify/source" && bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun scripts/verify-package.ts)
```

The verifier version references must have been aligned in the release PR. Also load the
**downloaded** archive in the isolated Plugin Tester and repeat readiness and key UI/
lifecycle checks. This catches wrong draft uploads even after a correct local build.

## Publish and check installation

Select exactly one command, according to the authorized release channel:

```sh
# Stable: publish and explicitly mark Latest.
gh-axi release edit "$release_tag" --draft=false --prerelease=false --latest=true
# Prerelease: publish without changing Latest.
gh-axi release edit "$release_tag" --draft=false --prerelease=true --latest=false
```

Reinspect release metadata and public download URLs. Confirm non-draft state, intended
prerelease/Latest status and all asset names/sizes. Download into another fresh directory
from the public release (also verify public access without release credentials), compare
the frozen bytes/checksums and rerun descriptor verification. Never rebuild to perform
this check.

In an isolated real Toolbelt profile, select this repository and exact release (enable
prereleases when needed), review the version/compatibility and approve execution. Confirm
the installed version/source/hash, readiness, screens, native quick view and update from
a compatible preceding package using copied fixture data. Verify removal/retention and
restart behavior. Do not replace the user's working app/profile as a release smoke test.
A Toolbelt bundled-seed update is a **separate host PR**: update the immutable public
archive URL and SHA-256 in Toolbelt `scripts/prepare-seed.ts`, run host seed validation/
build/tests and obtain review/CI. Publishing this release does not change the seed in
existing or future host builds automatically. Preserve disable/removal choices.

## Recovery

- **Before tagging:** fix the release PR/source and obtain a clean reviewed commit and
  green CI, then discard the failed candidate and build a new candidate. Do not publish
  dirty-source descriptors or waive checks.
- **Tag exists, no release yet:** verify the tag points to the approved commit and retain
  its exact frozen bytes. Resume draft creation/upload for that tag. Never move the tag.
  If those bytes are lost or the version/tag is wrong, stop and use a new version through
  another release PR; rebuilding is not a way to recover the same version.
- **Draft or partial upload:** inspect `isDraft` first, upload missing files from the
  frozen directory, then download and verify the whole set again. To replace a wrong
  asset only while the release is still unpublished, use
  `gh release upload "$release_tag" "$release_dir/<exact-asset-name>" --clobber`.
  This raw CLI flag deletes the existing matching asset before uploading; a failure can
  leave it absent. It must use retained approved bytes, never a rebuild, and always be
  followed by complete download/size/hash/metadata/readiness verification. Remove stray
  draft assets before publication. Do not use clobber on a published release.
- **Publish request times out:** inspect the release state before retrying. A successful
  publication with a lost response must not be treated as an unpublished draft.
- **Already published:** retain tags and immutable assets. Resume verification/install
  checks against the same bytes. Any source, metadata binding or package-content fix
  requires a new version/tag/release PR; do not rebuild, retag or replace published bytes.
  Coordinate withdrawal/advisory decisions with the maintainer if a release is defective.

See [architecture](architecture.md), the [README](../README.md), and Toolbelt's
[plugin authoring and update guide](https://github.com/tkarakai/toolbelt/blob/main/docs/plugins.md)
for the runtime/update contract. These release steps do not authorize main merges,
stable publication or user-data changes by themselves.
