# toolbelt-sdk-demo — notes for coding agents

The removable Toolbelt SDK demonstrator and capability conformance scenarios.
See `README.md`.

## Workflow (required)

### Architecture v2 work (feat/architecture2)

- Read [docs/architecture2.md](docs/architecture2.md) and its linked Toolbelt source-of-truth
  specification before v2 work. This branch initially contains planning documentation only;
  implementation requires a separate user assignment.
- Keep all v2 work on `feat/architecture2`. Do not merge to `main`, enable auto-merge, publish
  stable releases, or replace the user's working apps/data without a later explicit decision.
  Committing and pushing this long-lived branch is authorized.
- Never use the no-mistakes tool, plugin, skill, or pipeline. Work directly.

- **Never commit to `main` directly.** Branch (`feat/…`, `fix/…`), open a pull request, let CI
  pass, squash-merge. The PR title becomes the commit title on `main`. The `main` ruleset
  enforces this (`.github/settings/`).
- **One agent per checkout.** If `git status` shows changes you didn't make, stop and ask —
  another session may be working here.
- Add user-visible changes to `## Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md` in the same PR.
- Don't bump the version in feature PRs; that happens in a release PR.
- Workflow files: pin actions to full commit SHAs, keep `permissions` minimal. Only
  GitHub-owned actions, `oven-sh/setup-bun` and `zizmorcore/zizmor-action` are allowed.
- Use disposable fixtures only; never control real user processes or terminals.

## Bun

- Use `bun <file>`, `bun test`, `bun install`, `bun run <script>`, `bunx <pkg>` — not node,
  jest/vitest, npm/yarn/pnpm or npx.
